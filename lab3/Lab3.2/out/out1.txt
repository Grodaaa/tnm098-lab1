thanks jimmie i replied
 im going to try to stay this way
  my wife sat down beside me and studied me closely
 you look different she remarked
 to me at any rate
 youre sort of coming to a focus
 if only
 youre so different andstrange
  here was my chance to recover lost ground
  as near as i can make out i said ive had a kind of amnesia
 i know you of course and my name and that this is my house and that ponto is my dog even though he tried to bite me
 i know the pond club and the harvard club but thats about all i seem able to remember
 i cant recall where i work or where i bank or who my friends are or what kind of car i drive or what i was doing before yesterday afternoon
  she relaxed at the holy scientific word amnesia as though to name a mystery explained it
  but you were saying something about being on an aircraft carrier in the pacific she objected
  i laughed
 that must have been part of a very vivid dream i was having in a chair in the bar at the pond when ranty tolan woke me up
 it was one of those dreams which seemed so real that real life seemed like a dream
 it still does a bit
 thats where my alleged mind got stalled and im still floundering around
 help me wont you
  you didnt seem to need much help remembering virginia rutherford she remarked but ill try to fill in some of the gaps for you
 you have your own firmtompkins wasson and coneat no
 1 wall street
 its sort of combination brokerage office and investment counsel
 you once told me that your specialty was finding nice rich old ladies and helping them reinvest their unearned millions
 you bank at the national city farmers and your car is a black 41 packard coupe
  that helps a lot i thanked her
 now how about my friends
 if i go to town tomorrow i ought to be on the lookout for them
 business isnt so good right now that i can afford to let myself be run in as an amnesiac while my partners look after the loot
  she frowned
 i dont know much about your friends in town since so many of them are in the war she admitted
 theres merry vail of course who roomed with you at harvard but he hasnt come out here much since adela divorced him after that business in bermuda
 sometimes you talk about the men you see at the club but ive never been able to keep track of the phils and bills and neds and joes and dicks and harrys
 youll have to find your own way there
 at the office of course theres graham wasson and phil cone your partners but you wont have much trouble once youre at your desk
 wasson is dark and plump and cone is fair and plump and theyre both about five years younger than you are
  the office doesnt worry me i agreed
 i can handle anything that develops there
  you know winnie jimmie remarked if i were you i wouldnt try to go to town for a few days
 the office will run itself and you need a rest
 i dont know much about amnesia but ive always heard that rest and kind treatment  uhuh
 i dissented emphatically
 worst thing in the world for it
 ive always heard that the thing to do is to go back over the ground until you come to the thing that gave you the original shock and then it all comes back to you
 if i stick around bedford hills ill just get panicky over not being sure whether i remember things or not
 ill go to town in the morning and see if i cant find myself
  she laughed as wives laugh
 you may be a changed man she announced but youre still stubborn as a mule
 tell me to change the subject you say that you remember me
 tell me what i seem like to you now that youve changed as you say aside from age sex scars and distinguishing marks if any and marital status
  i closed my eyes and thought of dorothy as she had been that last night in hartford before she walked out and i decided to join the navy as a reserve officer
  you are piano music on a summer nightsomething scarlatti or mozartthin cool precise gay
 you are apple blossoms against a berkshire hillside
 you are the smoke of fallen leaves climbing into the cool october sky
 you are surf on a sandy beach with the gulls wheeling and the whitecaps racing past the lighthouse on the point
 you are bobsleds and hot coffee and doughnuts by a roaring wood fire
 and youre a lost child with two pennies in your fist looking in the window of a fivecent candyshop
  germaine relaxed
 except for that last bit winnie you made me sound like a yearround vacation resort or an ad for a new automobile
 youve mentioned almost everything about me except the one thing i obviously am
  which is
  a simple rather stupid woman i guess germaine sighed whos had everything in life except what she wants
  all women are simple i pontificated since what they want is simple
  you moron
 she blazed
 dont you see that no woman knows what she wants until she is made to want it
 you 


 you never made me want anything simple except to crack you over the head with something
  after she had left i sat for a long time
 there seemed to be nothing to do or say
 winnies domestic life was still in too much of a snarl for me to do the obvious thing and follow germaine upstairs and into her bedroom lock the door and kiss her tearstained face and tell her that i was sorry i had hurt her



 before it would be safe to accept her gambits i must first explore my business connections
 hadnt my wife said something about girls in the office
                                       my first stop in the morning after i had been careful to take a late commuting train in to the city in order to avoid business men who were sure to know and greet winnie tompkins was the pond club
  tammy was behind the bar and as soon as i entered he turned and mixed me a powerful pickmeup
 i drained it with the usual convulsive effort and then pretended to relax
  thanks tammy i said
 thats what i needed
 good morning mr
 tompkins he remarked
 im glad to see you back
 you were looking a trifle seedyif you dont mind my saying so sirwhen you were in here monday afternoon
  i took a day off in the country and got rested up i told him
 i feel fine now
 anybody in the club
  not just now sir
 a couple of gentlemen were asking for you yesterday afternoonthat would be tuesday
 that was commander tolan sir and a friend of his a mr
 harcourt his name was who hasnt been here before
 they asked me if you were at your home but i just laughed
 him gone home
 i said
 not while he has a girl and a flat on park avenue
 begging your pardon mr
 tompkins i knew you didnt want to be bothered wherever you were and so i said the first thing that came to my head
  youre doing fine tammy i assured him
 i dont want to see anybody for a couple of days
 now then id like you to tell me what happened here monday afternoon
 its the first time in my life ive ever drawn a complete blank
  well sir the club steward recited
 you came in about two oclock and sat down in your usual chairthat one in the corner
 you said something about having had lunch at the harvard club sir and had a couple of scotch and sodas here
  was i tight tammy
  not to call tight
 you didnt show it and after a time you went to sleep like you was tired out
 you was still sleeping when mr
 morgan mr
 davis and commander tolan came in
 that would be a little after three oclock sir
 they made some talk about how you were sleeping through the noise they made that it would take a bomb to wake you
 then sir i guess you had some kind of a dream
 you began talking like and thrashing with your arms and making noises
 so commander tolan he said jesus we cant drink with that going on and went and shook you by the shoulder until you woke up
 youd been dreaming all right mr
 tompkins because you talked wild when you woke up about alaska and where were you
 the others joked a bit about it after you left but id take my oath sir that you werent really what might be called tight mr
 tompkins
  thanks a million tammy i said
 thats a load off my mind
 i drew a blank and didnt know where id been or what id been doing
 can you let me have some money
 im a bit short of cash
  of course sir
 how much will you need
  a couple of hundred will do i told him if you have that much
  that will be easy sir
 if youll just sign a check like the house rules says ill get it from the safe
  he nearly caught me
 signing checks was something i simply could not do until i had learned to imitate winnie tompkins signature
 i had tried in the guestroom at bedford hills the previous evening and found that my original signature as frank e
 jacklin was completely unchanged by my transmigration and that my own copydesk scrawl was the only handwriting i could commit
 i had burned the notepaper on which i had made the crucial experiments and flushed the ashes down the toilet
 one of my objects in coming to the pond had been to see if i couldnt get money by simply initialing a chit
  i hastily looked in my billfold
 there was still a fair amount of money left
 it would last me until i found a way to draw on winnies bankaccount
  never mind after all i told tammy
 i guess i have enough to last me until i get down to the office
 if anybody asks for me you havent seen me since monday and dont know where i am
  very good sir he agreed
 ill take any messages that come for you sir and not let on ive set eyes on you
  my next stop was at an old hangout of mine and dorothys from my early newspaper days a place on east 53rd street where you can get a good meal if you have the money to pay for it and the time to wait for itand i had both
 i knew that none of winnies friends would be seen dead in the place and i didnt want to try lunch at the harvard club where id have to sign the diningroom order or the barcheck
 the place was reasonably uncrowdedit was not quite noonand i had a pleasant lunch
  it was a little after one oclock when i reached the harvard club
 the doorman glanced at my face and automatically stuck a little ivory peg in the hole opposite the name of tompkins on the list of members
 i checked my hat and coat and strolled through the sittingrooms into the large loungelibrary beside the diningroom
 a couple of men nodded and smiled as i passed them so i nodded back and said hi
 in a conversational tone
 in the lounge i found a chair and a copy of the worldtelegram so i decided to catch up with the warnews
 the german armies were beginning to crumble but there was still talk of a stand along the elbe and hitler was reported fortifying the mountaindistricts of southern germany into a redoubt for a last valhalla battle
 the pacific news was good
 the fighting on okinawa was going our way and the cleanup in the philippines was well in hand
 the navy department discounted enemy reports of heavy damage to american warships by jap suicidepilots but as an old navy p
r
o
 i could tell that it had been plenty
 id heard about the kamikazes from some of our pilots who had seen them off leyte and i had no doubt that they were doing a job on the 7th fleet
 roosevelt had gone south for a couple of weeks rest at warm springs georgia and ed stettinius was in the final throes of organizing the united nations conference at san francisco  hi winnie
 dont you speak to your old friends any more
  i looked up to see a lean wolfishlooking man with a gray moustache a slightly bald head and definitely bond street clothes
  oh hullo
 i said and returned to reading the paper
  the newspaper was firmly taken out of my hands and the man sat down beside me
  weve got to have a talk he said
  why
 whats happened
  theres been a lot of talk about you running around town in the last twentyfour hours winnie
 none of the other alleged friends we know had the guts to tell you
 but i thought your roommate  so youre merry vail i said stupidly
  youre in worse shape than i thought you were winnie he replied
 yes im merriwether vail who started his lifelong career of rescuing winfred tompkins from blondes and booze at harvard in 1916
 now if youll just crawl out of your alcoholic coma and listen to me for five minutes before you take off for your next skirt youll learn something to your advantage
  how about a drink merry
 i asked to keep in character
  not before five so help me and youd better lay off liquor till you hear this
 here it is
 theres a story going the rounds that the f
b
i
 is after you
 at any rate at least one obvious gman has been reported in full cry on your footprints
  i sat up startled
 this was too much even for purgatory
 what had winnie been up to
  what am i supposed to have done merry
 i asked
 trifled with the mann act
 told fibs on my income tax return
 failed to notify the local draft board that i was taking the train to new york
 bought black market nylons for my mistress
 or what
  vail looked mysterious
 for all i know i may be letting myself in for alcatraz old man but the dope is that youve been violating the espionage act communicating with the enemy or stealing official secrets
  i leaned back in my chair and shook with laughter
 of all the pure unadulterated b
s
 ive ever heard
 i give you my word of honor as a porcellian that theres not a syllable of truth in it
  vail looked increasingly distressed
 if youre really innocent youd better be careful
 tentoone you havent an alibi and youll need a lawyer
 slip me a bill now and retain me as your counsel
 no this isnt a gag
 somethings cooking even if its only mistaken identity and ive seen enough of the law in wartime to know that youll be better off with the old cry i demand to see my attorney when they march you down to the f
b
i
 headquarters to answer a few questions
  thanks merry i said and heres twenty bucks to go on with
 if the police are looking for me id better go down to my office and see that things are applepie before they lock up the brains of our outfit
  besides i added youve just given me an idea of how i can make a hell of a lot of money
