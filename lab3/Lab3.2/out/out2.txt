 winnie
 the voice that crackled at me over the wire had all the implacable tenderness of a woman who has you in the wrong
  yes dear
 i answered automatically with a passing thought for my own lost dorothy marooned in washington with a job in the o
s
s
  what is the matter
 the voice continued in its litany of angry possessiveness
 what on earth happened to you
 ive been waiting for you since three oclock
   where have you been waiting
  hereof course
 in our place
 in new york
 winnie whats wrong
  not a pleasant spot to be in even if it was only part of a trialrun in purgatory
  its a bit too hard to explain virginia i said but something came up and i dont think i can go through with it
 in fact i know i cant go through with it
  there was one of those pauses which make a whole lifetime seem like a splitsecond
  something came up
 the voice now a pantherish contralto purred dangerously
 something went down you mean
 you see winnie ive been talking to your friends
 johnny walker black label thats what went down
 at the pond club
 i tried out the scales and found that my involuntary host weighed over 195 poundsa good deal of it around the middle
 tommy morgan told me all about it
 you went to the pond had too much to drink woke up about four oclockone whole hour after you had promised to meet meand woke up talking wildly and then staggered out
 now i find youre back in bedford hills and itits my birthday
 the voice ended in a choke which might have been a sob or a paroxysm of feminine fury
  i summoned the old voice of authority as inculcated at quonset into the welltanned vocal chords of winfred tompkins
 virginia i commanded just stop making a fool of yourself
 im sorry i stood you up but things have been happening
 i just cant go through with it
 ill explain when i see you
  youd better
 and the slam of the receiver left my ears ringing
  when i turned around my wife was smiling with a glint in her eye which was far from sympathetic
  poor winnie
 she observed
 youd better stick to your office stenographers and not go picking up redheaded married women in westchester
 you havent got a chance
  i refilled my glass and hers in that ordera husbandly gesture which put me i felt on a solid married basis for the moment
  jimmie i announced
 i dont need to tell you that im an awful heel
 now that weve got the wraps off i wish youd tell me what you really think of me and virginia
  mrs
 tompkins nostrils flickered slightly
 i never cared for bulging redheads myself she said
 when she was at miss spences we called her virgin for short but not for long
 there never was a thing in pants up to and including scarecrows that she wouldnt carry the torch for
 when she married jerry rutherford it was a great relief to her relatives
 she had no friends
  a very succinct summary for all that it should be written in letters of fire i remarked
 and now what do you think of me
  she took a long sip of her drink and leaned forward
 youre fat soft and spoiled winnie physically mentally and morally she began and you know it
 if you werent so stinking rich youdwell i dont know
 theres something about you thatswell after you bought me from my parents i wanted to kill myself and then i sized you up
 theres no real harm in you winnie its not hard to like you but you never were loves young dream
  what you say is absolutely on the beam i admitted
 but while were on the subject i wouldnt call jerry rutherford the answer to a maidens prayer
 that hollywood doctor type with the swank suburban practice and the soft bedroom manner gets me down
 he has only three ideas in the world and all of them begin with i
 after the first antiseptic raptures youd have nothing in common but your appendix and hed want to get away with thatfor a consideration
  jimmie giggled
 you forget that he already has it she said
 thats how i was first attracted to him under the ether cone
 i was sick as a dog and he held my hand and told me i was being very brave
  and sent the hell of a bill to me i added
  well she asked after a pause
 what do you really think of me
  i think jimmie that youre lonely bored and unhappy
 all three are my fault but they are driving you to make a fool of yourself
 nobody has tried to understand youwhich is catnip for any person of either sex once you get them talking about themselvesleast of all your husband
 you need what other women needchildren a home



  if this is a buildup for obstetrics the answer is no
 she snapped angrily
  skip it
 i urged
 im telling you the truth not making a pass at you
 we can talk some more about you in the morning
 in the meantime i think ill turn in
 im very tired a little tight and ive had a lousy day
  she flashed me a curious look
 go on up winnie she said
 ill put these things away
 youll need your strength for the morning if i know virginia rutherford
  guided by luck and the smell of pipe tobacco i found what was obviously the masters roomwith a weird amalgam of etchings of ducks and nude girls including one zorn and all the gadgets for making sleep as complicated as driving an automobile
  i was awakened in the morning by a hand on my shoulder
 it was marymyrtle
  youd better get up and put on your pyjamas and dressing gown she remarked conversationally
 dr
 rutherford is downstairs and mrs
 rutherford is talking with mrs
 tompkins in her bedroom
  stormy weather
  ill say soand see here she began
  sit down mary
 i ordered
  she subsided on the edge of the bed and looked at me rebelliously
  from now on mary i announced things are going to be different around here
 i wont refer to what is past because youre old enough to know what youre doing and so am i
 if you want to stay on and really help me through a hard time ill double your wages
 if youd rather goand i wouldnt blame youill pay you six months wages in advance and you can clear out
 but i cant be worried about you and your feelings when i have a big problem to clean up here
 will you go or stay
  the girl thought for a moment then rose straightened her apron and gave me the first friendly smile i had received since my arrival from the aleutians
  ill stay mr
 tompkins she said
 and heres a pickmeup i mixed for you
 better drink it before you see the rutherfords
  okay
 and i drank it and it worked its beneficent will upon me
 now ill go and kill dr
 rutherford if youll toss me my flitgun and thanks
  dr
 rutherford was pacing with surgical precision up and down my den
 he looked slightly more selfpossessed than the day before and seemed to be in excellent physical condition
 i guessed at the contour beneath my wadded black silk dressing gown and reconsidered my original plan to throw him bodily out of the house for having come without my invitation
  see here tompkins he said briskly
 were both men of the world i hope
 things cant go on like this
 i was up all night with virginia
 youre not behaving at all well you know old man
  i sat down in the corner of the leather lounge and looked up at hima move which gave me a slight advantage of position in dealing with the higher emotions
  lets not mince words jerry i said
 suppose you just state frankly what you think we should do
  germaine loves me and does not love you rutherford stated crisply
 you love virginia and she loves you
 none of us wish a divorce
 hang it all winnie were civilized
 these things happen you know and we might just as well face them
 we agreed that the four of us should do as we liked and no hard feelings
  i sighed
 jerry i said
 what you say was true as of yesterday noon but if these things can happen they can also unhappen
 whatever you and my wife decide to do is your own affair but im damned if i intend to allow her to use my home as a place of assignation and im damned if ill let her become the subject of gossip
 so far as virginia is concerned whether or not she is in love with me im no longer in love with her and im damned if ill play gigolo to spare the feelings of a bulging redhead who carries the torch for anything in trousers up to and including scarecrowsmyself included
  i cant allow you to talk that way about my wife tompkins
 its rotten bad form and anyhow we both know that people are the way their glands make them and nothing can be done about it
  here have a drink
 i suggested
 this is all under the seal of a confessional
 im not quarreling with you
 im consulting you
 i dont love virginia and i dont believe i ever did
 if you wish to wriggle out of your marriage thats your affair
  and its yours too ever since that night at the war bond ball he said
 dont forget that i caught you  rutherford i replied
 as a medical man you have surely seen far worse than that
 you cant sue me for alienation of affections because all bedford hills is aware of virginias glands and because it wouldnt help your practice
 for the rest im willing to listen to anything as a way out of this mess
  he paused in his precise pacing
 the four of us will have to talk it over he said as soon as i have that drink you offered me
  okay i agreed
 the girls are in jimmies bedroom
 perhaps you know the way better than i do
 ill follow your lead
  germaine was propped up in a frilly fourposter bed amid a wallow of small satin cushions
 i barely had time to notice that she was wearing a rather filmy night gown when i turned to reap the whirlwind in the form of five foot six of redhaired determination and curves
  now winnie she commanded
 whats all this nonsense
  i caught a telltale glimpse of uncharitable diamonds at my wifes breast and hastily averted my eyes from the monogram
  virginia i replied theres nothing wrong
 nothing at all
 it was just that yesterday i realized that i couldnt go through with it
 i dont pretend to be moral but i wont go in for mixeddoubles at my age
 its undignified
  what
 mrs
 rutherfords mouth hung open in amazement
  only this virginia
 whatever i have been in the past im going to try to be different in the future
 i know its hard on you but  the redhead laughed like tumbrils rolling to the guillotine
 nothing to what a breach of promise suit would be to you winnie dear
 dont forget i have your letters
  now were getting somewhere i remarked
 how much
  winnie
 my wife gasped
 its blackmail
  of course its blackmail i agreed and there are times when its wiser to pay than to fight
 this is not one of them
 virginia im not interested in buying back those letters
 save them for a rainy day
 im going to settle with your husband
 how about it jerry
  you swine
 mrs
 rutherford was going definitely gradeb in the pinches
 do you think that you can drive a wedge between me and my husband
  no my wife has already done that for me
 he loves her and he tells me that she loves him
 ive told him that theyre welcome to a divorce but i wont have my house used for any hankypanky and wont have people gossip about germaine
 they can make up their minds what they want to do about it
  you were saying downstairs tompkins the doctor hastily interrupted that you would listen to any reasonable offer
  check
 whats your price
  i want out said dr
 rutherford
 lend me the value of a years practicefifteen thousand would cover itand ill get in a substitute and take a crack at the army medical corps
 theyve been after me for a couple of years
  done
 i said and if you like ill have the bank dole it out to virginia while youre gone so she wont use it up too fast
  what about me
 asked my wife
 i thought jerry said he loved me
  whats your price
 i asked
  germaine yawned and the shoulder strap of her gown slipped indiscreetly
 since nobody seems to want me she declared im going to stick around and see the fun
 i wouldnt miss the sight of winnie tompkins trying to lead a changed life for all the doctors in the medical corps
  me too
 spat out mrs
 rutherford
 theres something pretty mysterious going on here and im going to stay until i learn all the answers
  there was a tap at the bedroom door and myrtle appeared pulling two neatly set breakfast trays on a rubbertired mahogany teawagon
  i thought you would rather have your breakfast upstairs with the master mam she remarked primly in a far too english countryhouse manner
 breakfast is waiting for dr
 and mrs
 rutherford in the diningroom she added
  and as she bent over the table and began to straighten out the breakfast things the girl had the impudence to slip me a wink
