  a pretty darkhaired maid opened the door of pooks hill with a twitch of the hip that was wasted on bedford hills
  oh its you
 she remarked conversationally
 shall i tell mrs
 tompkins you are here
  and why not
 i asked
  she looked at me slanteyed
 why not sir
 she must have forgotten to eat an apple this morning
 thats why
  where shall i dump my hat and coat mary
 i asked guessing wildly at her name
 suburban maids were named mary as often as not
  the name is myrtle mr
 tompkins she replied and did not bother to add the as well you know she implied
  from now on myrtle you shall be mary so far as i am concerned
 and where mary shall i leave my hat and coat
  in the den sir of course
 come ill lend a hand
 youve been drinking again
  the girl moved quite close to me in helping me off with my things and it was only by a distinct effort of will that i refrained from giving that provocative hip the tweak it so openly invited
  this way mr
 tompkins she said sarcastically so i rewarded her with a halfhearted smack which brought the requisite oh
you never can tell when you will need a friend below stairs and it was obvious that winnie the dog
 had been trifling with her young buttocks if not her affections
 that sort of thing must stop if i was going to get anywhere in my run through the maze
 too abrupt a change in the manners and morals of winfred tompkins however might arouse suspicion
  any news today mary
 i asked
  nothing sir
 the kennels telephoned to say that ponto had made a miraculous recovery and could come home tomorrow
 i had them send word to the club to tell you
 and mrs
 tompkins as i said forgot to eat her apple
  i looked at her
 this was a cue
 i mustnt miss it
  and the doctor didnt keep away
 i asked
  him
 i should say not
 mrs
 tompkins felt quite unsettled right after lunch and phoned dr
 rutherford to come over
 hes with her now upstairs giving her an examination
 she rolled her eyes significantly in the direction of the second story
  wait a few minutes till i catch my breath and get my bearings mary i said and then tell mrs
 tompkins most discreetly if you know what i mean that i have returned and am waiting in my i waved vaguely at the room
  in your den sir she agreed
 the name is myrtle
  the den was one of those things i have never attained perhaps because i never wanted to
 there was a fieldstone fireplace over which the antlered head of a small stag presided with four upturned feetlike a calf in a butcher shopthat held two well dusted shotguns
 the walls were lined with books up to a dadobooks in sets with red morocco and gilt bindings dickens thackeray surtees robert louis stevenson dumas balzac and similar standard authorsall highly respectable and mostly unread
 on the table beside a humidor and cigarette cases was a formidable array of unused pipes
 above the shelves the walls were adorned with etchings of ducks ducks sitting ducks swimming ducks nesting ducks flying and ducks hanging dead
 it was as though winnies conscience or attorney had advised him you cant go wrong on ducks old boy
 instead he had gone wild
  in one corner of the den my unregenerate navy eye discerned a small portable bar with gleaming glasses decanters and syphons
 further investigation was rewarded by the makings of a very fair scotchandsoda
 to my annoyance the cigarette box contained only de luxe benson  hedgesit would
while i am a sucker for tareytons
 still any cigarette is better than no cigarette
 a little mooching around the fireplace revealed the switch which turned on an electric fire ingeniously contrived to represent an expensive manhattan architects idea of smouldering peat
 the whole effect was very cosy in the town and country sensea gentlemans gunroomand i had settled down most comfortably on the broad leather divan in front of this synthetic blaze when i was interrupted by an angry tenor voice
  i say tompkins soared the voice
 i thought we had agreed to be civilized about this thing
  i raised my head to see a lean darkhaired dapper little man with a dinky little british raj mustache and a faint odor of antiseptics glaring at me from the doorway
  dr
 rutherford i presume
 i remarked
  yes winnie came a pleasant but irritated womanly voice from somewhere behind the doctor and i too would like to know what this means
  is that you jimmie
 i guessed
  of course its me
 who else did you expect
 one of those flashy blondes from your office
  sh
 shushed the doctor reprovingly
 what about virginia
 what have you done with her
  this required serious thought
 the glass of scotch was a good alibi for amnesia
 to whom do you refer
 i asked putting a slight thickness into my voice
  to virginia my wife
 he snapped
 we agreedit was understood between the four of us  i shook my head virtuously
 i havent set eyes on her all day i said
 i dont know where she is and i refuse to be held responsible for her in any particular
 shes your lookout not mine
  why you
 the doctor started forward menacing me with his surgical little fists
  wait a minute jerry the contralto voice ordered
 let me handle this
  germaine tompkins stepped forward into the room and stood in the flickering light of the electric peat
 tell me winnie she asked has anything gone wrong
  my wife was a tall slim girl with dark eyes dark hair parted sleekly in the 1860 style and a cool slender neck
 she was wearing something lowcut in black velvet with a white cameo brooch at the v of a bodice which suggested a potentially undemure quakeress
 i noticed that she had angry eyes a sulky mouth and a puzzled expression
  im sorry jimmie i replied after a good look at her but i have decided that i simply couldnt go through with it
  do you mean to say dr
 rutherford began only to be hushed by germaine
 let me handle him jerry she whispered
 youd better go
 hes tight
 ill phone you in the morning
  all right if you say so dear the doctor obeyed
  and be sure to send me a bill for this call i added
 professional services and whatnot
 and dont come back to my house without my personal invitation
  dr
 rutherford emitted a muttered comment and disappeared into the gloom of the hall
 my wife followed him and i could hear a series of confused and comforting whispers sending him on his way
 i had finished my scotch and poured myself another before my wife rejoined me
  have a drink
 i asked
  no thank you
 she snapped
  mad at me
  what do you think
 her tone was cool enough to freeze lava
  you have every right to be
 that answer i had found by experience was unanswerable
  what do you mean
 she asked in some bewilderment
 yes thanks i will have a drink after all
 you see winnie after we had talked it all over the other night after the bond rally dance and realized how we felt about it all the four of us decided to bewellcivilized about things
 and now  i dont feel civilized about my wife i said pouring her a stiff one
  her eyes glittered and her cheek was tinged with color
 in spite of her anger she responded to the idea of male brutes contesting for her favor
  i didnt think you cared a damn she said at last and its pretty late in the day to make a change now
 after all there is virginia
  that was the cue to clinch the situation
 to hell with virginia
 i announced
 id rather live with you as your friend than sleep with la rutherford in ten thousand beds
 i cant help it i added boyishly
  she leaned forward and sniffed
 you have been drinking havent you
 she remarked
  of course i have
 today in town i suddenly realized what a damn fool id been to throw away something really fine for something very secondrate
 so i drank
 too much
 and the more i drank the more i knew that i was right and that it was here where i belong with you
 if you dont want me to stay ill go over to the country club for the night
 ill even phone jerry rutherford for youhim and his moustachebut im damned if ill go running back to virginia
 shes not pukka
 howm i doing
 i added silently for the benefit of the master of ceremonies
  well she said after a long pause
 perhapsits so mixed upperhaps youd better go to bed here and we can talk it over in the morning
 all of us
  i shook my head
 i dont want to hold any more massmeetings on the state of our mutual affections
 if you want that tenor tonsilsnatcher youre welcome to him but im damned if ill be a good sport about it
 if you insist ill buy you a divorce but i wont marry virginiathats final
  germaines face relaxed
 she smiled
 well see how things look to you in the morning she said
  now was the time to play the trump card
  oh yes i said
 i brought home a present for you
  i walked over to the hanger in the corner and pulled the tiffany packages from my overcoat pocket
  here you are jimmie tompkins i said with all my alleged love
  alleged is right
 but she picked eagerly at the wrappings and swiftly ferreted out the diamond brooch
 why winnie its lovely she began then whirled on me her eyes blazing
 is this a joke
 she demanded
  of course not
 whats the matter
  her laugh was wild
 oh nothing winnie
 nothing at all
 its just that you should have decided to give meon her birthdaya brooch with her initials in diamonds
 see them
 v
m
r
  so thats the catch i thought
 i should have guessed there would be something wrong with the setup and i kicked myself for not having bothered to trace out the monogram
  dont you see what i mean i grated or must i spell it out for you
 some time back when we were considering all this civilized swapping of husbands and wives i put in the order at tiffanys for virginias birthday present
 today when i picked it up the clerk smirked at mehe knows your initials dont begin with vand i suddenly knew i couldnt go ahead with the whole business
 so i brought the brooch back to you as a trophy if you want it
 you can do what you like about it
 its yours
 you see jimmie i added thats the way things are
 im burning all my bridges
  oh
 she said
 then after a long pause she added ah
  i dont think she remarked after another pause that ill want to keep this and im far too fond of virginia rutherford to humiliate her
 i think ill just take this back to tiffanys and get something else
  so i had led trumps
  heres something else to be going on with i told her
 i got this for you anyhow win lose or drawand i produced the gold bracelet
 i thought it would go with that dress and your cameo andif you still want to wear ityour wedding ring
  she cast quick glances from side to side like a bird that suspects a snare
  its good she sighed
 winnie its so good
 i guess



  there was a knock at the door
 it was myrtlemary
  will the master be staying for dinner mrs
 tompkins
 she asked
  of course i will mary i said
 is there enough to eat
  ill see sir she replied in a manner which was practically an insult to us both
  and keep a civil tongue in your head i added
  she handed it back to me
 and keep your hands to yourself sir she said as she closed the door
  winnie
 it was jimmies hand restraining me as i started up
  let her go
 i said at last
 its my fault i guess
 i havent been happy and i did make a few passes
 from now on ill try to be a bit more decent and livable
 god knows i have plenty to be ashamed of but nothing disgraceful 


 i hope
  so do i my wife began
 if you



  the telephone rang
  she picked up the receiver and listened for a moment frowning
  yes hes here she said passing me the instrument
  its for you she observed
 its virginia calling from new york and she sounds most annoyed
