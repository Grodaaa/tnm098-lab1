 tompkins wasson  cone maintained sincerelooking offices on one of the upper floors of no
 1 wall street
 the rooms were carefully furnished in dark wood and turkeyred upholstery in a style calculated to reassure elderly ladies of great wealth that the firm was careful and conservative
  the girl at the reception desk looked as though she had graduated with honor from wellesley in the class of 1920 and still had itpincenez and condescensionbut she was thoroughly uptodate in her officetechnique
  oh mr
 tompkins she murmured in a clear low voice theres a gentleman waiting to see you in the customers room a mr
 harcourt
 hes been here since ten oclock this morning
  hes had no lunch
 i inquired
  she shook her head
  i clucked my tongue
 we cant have our customers starve to death can we
 send out for a club sandwich and some hot coffee
 give me five minutes to take a look at my mail and then send him in
 when the food arrives send that in too
 i clean forgot
  she blinked her hazel eyes behind her pincenez to show that she understood and i walked confidently down to the end of the corridor to where a mr
 tompkins stared at me conservatively from a glazed door
  my office lived up to my fondest dream of winnie
 it was an ingenious blend of the 1870s and functional furniturelike a cocktail of port wine and vodka
 there were electric clocks a silenced stockticker in a glasscovered mahogany coffin an elaborate sheraton radio with shortwave reception tuned in on wqxr and desks and chairs and divans and a really good steel engraving showing general grant receiving lees surrender at appomattox court house with a chart underneath to explain who was who in the picture
  the desk i was glad to note was bare except for an electric clockcalendar which told me that it was 312 p
m
 of april 4 1945 and a handsome combination humidor cigarette case and automatic lighter in aluminum and synthetic tortoiseshell
 a glance out the window gave me a reassuring glimpse of the spire of trinity church
 there was a single typed memo on the glass top of the desk which read mr
 harcourt 1013 a
m
 would not state business
 will wait
  i pushed one of the array of buttons concealed underneath the edge of the desk and a door opened to admit a largish blonde in a tightfitting sweater
  yes mr
 tompkins
  please have mr
 harcourt sent in i said and when he comes bring your notebook and take a stenographic record of our conversation anderwhats your name
  she raised her wellplucked eyebrows
 im eleanor roosevelt my parents named me arthurjeanafter both of themarthurjeanmiss briggs to you
  very well miss briggs tell mr
 harcourt ill see him now
  a moment later she reappeared holding a card in her fingers as though it was a live cockroach
 sure you want to see this
 she asked
  the card read mr
 a
 j
 harcourt special agent
 federal bureau of investigation u
 s
 department of justice u
 s
 court house foley square new york 23 n
 y
  of course i replied ive been expecting him for some time
  a
 j
 harcourt was neat but not gaudy a cleancut hart shaffner and marx tailored man of about thirtyfive with that indefinable family resemblance to j
 edgar hoover which always worries me about the f
b
i
  good afternoon mr
 harcourt i said pleasantly and what can i do for the f
b
i

  harcourt shook my hand took a seat refused a cigarette and cast a doubtful glance over his shoulder at arthurjean briggs who was working semisilently away at a stenotype machine
  oh thats my secretary i explained
 i always have her take a record of important conversations in this office
 i hope the machine doesnt disturb you mr
 harcourt
  if its all right with you its all right with me he said grudgingly
 i thought perhaps youd rather have this private
  not in the least i replied
 miss briggs is the soul of discretion and i can imagine nothing we could talk about that i wouldnt want her to hear
  the gman looked as though he was worrying over whether he ought to call washington for permission
 they hadnt taught him this one in the f
b
i
 academy of fingerprinting marksmanship shadowing and wiretapping
  by the way mr
 harcourt i added i just learned as i came in that youve been waiting for me since ten this morning
 its after three now so i took the liberty of sending out for a sandwich and some coffee for you
 i thought you might like a bite of lunch while you are talking with me
  the special agent looked as surprised as though he had found hoovers fingerprints on the murdergun but he nodded gamely
  here it is now i remarked as there was a knock on the door and a knowinglooking boy placed an appealing trayload of sandwiches pickles and coffee in front of mr
 harcourt
  now you go right ahead and eat your lunch i urged
 ask me for any information in my possession and you shall have it
 and of course ill have miss briggs send a complete transcript of our talk to you at f
b
i
 headquarters by registered mail
 first of all if you dont mind would you show me your official identification and let miss briggs take down the number and so on
 its always best to put these things in the record isnt it
  the gman gulped and produced a battered identity card complete with fingerprints number hoovers signature and a photograph which would have justified his immediate arrest on suspicion of bankrobbery
  i imagine mr
 harcourt i remarked that youve had plenty of time in the last five hours to question members of my staff about whatever it is you think they might know about my business
  he looked up almost pathetically
 i asked a few questions he admitted
 this is just an informal inquiry
 nothing for grand jury actionyet
  i didnt like that last word
  do you think i ought to call my lawyer in before i proceed with our talk
 i asked
 i resent your reference to grand jury action
 so far i dont even know what you wish to see me about and you have just made a libelous statement in front of a reliable witness
 is that the way j
 edgar hoover trains his gestapo
  iwell  come on harcourt lets get on with it
 i interrupted
 im a busy man and youve wasted five hours of the time my taxes help to pay for just waiting to take more of my time
  he pulled a black leather notebook out of his pocket and consulted it
  the bureau was asked to interrogate you mr
 tompkins on behalf of another government agency
  which
 internal revenue
 w
p
b

 the s
e
c
  no sir it was none of those
 im not at liberty to tell you which one
 i am simply instructed to ask you what you know about u
s
s
 alaska and naval dispositions in the north pacific
  i leaned back and laughed
 now i get it i said
 thats o
n
i and that tripleplated ass ranty tolan trying to win the war in the barrooms of new york
 it all goes back to a dream i had while i was dozing at the pond club monday afternoon
 something about the u
s
s
 alaska being blown up off the aleutians
 tolan was there when i woke up and i passed a few remarks about my dream before i was fully awake if you know what i mean
 thats all there is to it mr
 harcourt
  the special agent made a number of hentracks in his notebook
  thank you very much mr
 tompkins he said
 no doubt youll be able to explain things if my chief wants to call you in
 i dont think my chief believes in dreams
 not that kind of dream
 not in wartime
  i laughed again
 im afraid i cant help that
 so far as i am concerned the f
b
i
 can believe in my dream or stick it in the files
  harcourt coughed
 its not easy working with o
n
i or other intelligence outfits he said
 they never tell us anything
 the trouble with your dream seems to be that the general public isnt supposed to know that the u
s
s
 alaska is in commission and that the navy department has had no word from her since last saturday
  dont let that worry you i said
 if she was anywhere near the kuriles shed keep radio silence specially off paramushiro
  oh
 harcourt remarked
 o
n
i
 didnt say anything about paramushiro
 thank you mr
 tompkins
 well be in touch with you off and on
  he rose very politely shook hands again thanked me for the food nodded to miss briggs and made a definitely grade a exit
  his steps died away down the corridor
 miss briggs waited until he was out of earshot then turned to me
 you god damned fool
 she said fondly
 you had him bluffed until you talked about paramushiro
 why did you admit anything
  i looked up at her broad pleasant face
  so youve made a monkey out of me
 i alibied you up and down
 listen winnie the f
b
i
 have been all over the joint since early yesterday
 we were warned not to whisper a word to you
 there was an agent waiting to grill me when i got home last night
 i told him youd been spending the weekend with me
  you told him i was startled
  sure
 why not
 he wasnt interested in my morals
 i told him about our place up in the fifties and gave you a complete alibi from friday close of business until monday noon
 and now you have to make like a nazi with the ships in the pacific
 say what is it youve supposed to have donekissed macarthur
  damned if i know miss briggs
 thats part of the trouble
  lay off that miss briggs stuff
 that was to punish you for giving me the fisheye when you came in
 im your arthurjean and the markets closed so youd better catch the subway uptown with me and ill cook you a steak dinner at our place
  this was too deep water for hesitation so i took the plunge
 taking my hat and coat i told the genteel receptionist that id be back in the morning
 i waited for arthurjean at the foot of the elevators and followed her lead into the east side subway and up to the 51st street station on to our place
  it was very discreetan old brownstone front converted into small apartments
 there was no doorman and an automatic elevator prevented any intrusive check on the comings and goings of the tenants
 the thirdfloor front had been made into a pleasant little tworoom suitea masters bedroom why not mistresss
 i thought with a doublebed dresser and chairs and an array of ducks which revealed the true tompkins touch
 there was a small sittingdining room as well and a kitchenette with a satisfactory array of bottles in the frigidaire and a reasonable amount of groceries
  arthurjean took off her hat and coat fixed me a good stiff drink and then disappeared into the bathroom
 after a good deal of splashing and gurgling she reappeared clad in maroon satin pyjamas
  there she said now i feel better
  i smiled at her
 heres to arthurjean
 i said
  nuts to arthurjean she replied
 how about winnie
 youve always been swell to me and you know it
 i dont care if youre a louse or a souse
 you can always come to me any time youre in trouble and ill fix you up
 now youre in trouble with the cops so how about me helping you
 huh
  youre a good kid i said truthfully for arthurjean was indeed one of gods own sweet tarts
 the truth is im in all kinds of a jam
 you see i cant seem to remember what ive been doing before last monday
 its sort of like loss of memory only worse
 this f
b
i
 thing is only one of my headaches
  she looked at me questioningly
 so you dont remember where you were before monday
 she asked
 she slouched across the room leaned down and gave me a hearty kiss
 will that help you remember
 it was like i told that detective
 you and me were right here in this place over easter and dont forget it
  i sighed
 i liked arthurjean though she was as cornedbeef and cabbage to germaines caviar and champagne
 okay i said
 i wont forget it
  attaboy
 she agreed
 now that weve got that settled suppose you tell me where the hell you really were over the weekend
 you stood me up friday night and todays the first time ive set eyes on you since you left the office friday morning
 boy you may have some explaining to do to the f
b
i
 but its nothing to what you got to explain to momma
