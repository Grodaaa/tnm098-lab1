 after a pleasant breakfast in the course of which my wife read the social news in the new york heraldtribune and i the business news in the new york times i excused myself and returned to my bedroom
 winnies bathroom was fitted with all the gadgets too and there was an abundant choice of razors from the oldfashioned straightedge suicides favorite to the 1941 streamlined electric yankee clipper
 i tried out the scales and found that my involuntary host weighed over 195 poundsa good deal of it around the middle
 oh well a few weeks of setting up exercises would take care of that
 a cold shower and a brisk rub made me feel a little more presentable and i climbed shamelessly into winnies most manly tweeds
  are you catching the ten oclock dear
 germaine called from her bedroom
  no such luck
 i warned her
 phone the office will you and tell them im feeling under the weather and wont be in till sometime tomorrow
  this seemed like a good chance to do some exploringsince the rutherfords had temporarily abandoned the fieldthough i neednt have bothered since i had seen photographs of suburban houses like pooks hill in a score of different slickpaper prewar magazines
 there was the inevitable colonialtype diningroom with dark wainscoting below smooth oysterwhite plaster electric candlesconces and the necessary array of family silver on the antiqued mahogany sideboard
 the windows gave a vista of brown lawn with the grass still blasted by winter
 there was the inevitable chintzy livingroom with a permanently unemployed grandpiano two or three safely secondrate paintings by safely firstrate defunct foreigners
 there was the usual array of sofas easy chairs small middlesized and biggish tables with lots of china ashtrays and a sizable woodburning fireplace
 of course you entered the livingroom by two steps down from the front hall and there was a separate uptwostepsentrance to my den
 and sure as death and taxes there was a veritable downstairs lavatory
  i slipped on my coat and hat and stepped out through a french window which led from the livingroom to the inevitable paved stone terrace
 there were galvanized iron fittings for a summer awning and in the center was a cute little bronze sundial
 this had an exclamation point and the inscription over the yardarm at the place where noon should be and a bronze cocktail glass instead of the sign for four p
m
 all the way around the rest of the circle was written in heavy embossed capitals the hell with it
  my meditations on this facet of the tompkins characterand i wondered whether i oughtnt to spell facet with a uwere interrupted by myrtle
  oh mr
 tompkins she called from the kitchen window in complete repudiation of her earlier appearance as watson third ladys maid at barony castle the man from the kennels is here with ponto
 where shall i tell him to take the dog
  i hurried back indoorsthere was still a chill in the air and i really prefer my trees with their clothes onand found a gnarled little man who reeked of saddlesoap and servility
  well sir mr
 tompkins he beamed the old retainer at me
 that dog of yours had a close call a mighty close call
 thought he was a sureenough goner
 tried everything injections oxygen iron lung enema
 no dice
 then yesterday afternoon he just lay down and went to sleep and i thought my
 wont mr
 tompkins feel bad
 but he woke up large as life and twice as natural and began carrying on so that i guess he wanted to come home to his folks
 hes a mite weak mr
 tompkins very weak i might say but hell get well quicker here than at my place and ill pop in every other day to keep track of him
 never did see anything like the recovery that dog made in all my born days
 now about his bowels  i waited until he had to draw a breath and made swift to congratulate him on his professional skill
 i wouldnt have lost ponto for a thousand dollars i said
 lets get him out of your car and up in my bedroom i added
 hes been like a member of the family and  a series of deep bass backs interrupted me followed by ominous sounds of a heavy body hurling itself recklessly around inside a small enclosed space
  there
 said the vet
 he recognized your voice
 come on ponto
 ill fetch you
 hes pretty weak mr
 tompkins but hell get strong fast if you feed him right
  the vet twinkled out the front door and returned shortly leading a perfectly enormous coalblack great dane on a plaited leather leash
 ponto did not look very weak to me but ive always been fond of dogs and i figured that kindness to animals might count in my favor
 good dog i condescended
 poor old fellow
  the poor old fellow gave a low but hungry growl and lunged for me with bared teeth dragging the vet behind him like a dory behind a fishing schooner
 i jumped into the den and slammed the door while ponto sniffed snapped and grumbled on the far side of my defenses
  tell you what doctor i called through the panels
 take him upstairs and put him in my room
 its the one to the right at the head of the stairs
 hes just excited
 shut him in and as soon as hes calmed down ill make him comfortable
  while this rather cowardly solution was being put into effect i sat down and thought it over
 apparently winnie had been the kind of man whose pet dog tried to rip his throat out
 that was puzzling since from what i remembered of him at school he had if anything been only too amiable
 i waited out the vets lastminute report and instructions and then rang the bell for the maid
  mary i said will you help the doctor with his hat and coat and then take ponto a bowl of water
 the poor old fellows had a rough time
  the vet departed and i listened while the maid went upstairs
 then there was a scream the crash of breaking china and the sound of a door being slammed
 i bounded up the steps to find mary whitefaced and trembling looking stupidly at the broken remains of a white china bowl and a sizeable puddle of water on the hardwood floor outside my bedroom
  the door of my wifes room burst open and jimmie appeared with a wild what on earth
  its that dog sir gasped myrtle
 when i comecamein with the bowl of water like you said there he was lying ononyour bed like a human andand  and what
 i demanded
  and he was wearing your pyjamas sir she sobbed
 itsits  uncanny germaine supplied the word
  i gave a hollow laugh
 he probably remembers that he isnt allowed to lie on the beds mary and may have dragged my pyjamas up there to lie on
 whenever i let him up on the furniture i always make him lie on some of my clothes
  oh myrtle said suddenly calm
 is that it
 it was just that it looked sort of queer to see his legs in the pyjama trousers
  well dont worry about it now myrtle my wife remarked firmly
 im not surprised it gave you a shock
 hes such a big dog
 ill go in and see that hes comfortable
 come on winnie
 lets take a look at him
 whats the matter
 she added noticing a certain reluctance in my attitude
  nothing much i martyrized
 its only that he flew for my throat when he got inside the door
  nonsense
 she replied in the firm tone of a woman who knows better and who in any case expects her husband not to be afraid of a mere infuriated great dane
 you know ponto always puts his paws on your shoulders and licks your face every morning as you taught him
  my rollicking laughter was a work of art
 of course that was it i agreed and hed been away from us so long that he was overeager
 come on lets see if we cant make the poor beast comfortable
  but i let her lead the way
  the poor beast was lying panting on my still unmade bed
 the flowered chinese silk pyjamas which i had worn at breakfast were indeed strangely twisted around its gaunt body
 the coat was across the animals shoulders and both of its hindlegs were sticking through one of the trouserlegs
  there
 ponto
 poor old fellow
 cooed jimmie in a voice which would have charmed snails from their shells
  ponto gave a selfpitying whine and his tail thumped the pillow like an overseers whip across the back of uncle tom
 my wife patted the animals head and ponto positively drooled at her
 she gently disentangled him from among the pyjamas and hung them up in the closet
 as she turned toward the bed he jumped to the floor reared up put both paws on her shoulders and licked her face convulsively giving little whines and shiverings
  poor old fellow poor old ponto
 she crooned
 was he glad to get home from the nasty old kennel
 there
 and she massaged his ears
 come on now ponto she remarked more authoritatively say good morning to your master
  the answer was a grand diapason of a growl and the baring of a thicket of gleaming white fangs in my direction
  ponto
 she ordered as the beast positively cringed
 say good morning to the master
  he slumped to the floor with the grace of a poleaxed calf and approached me slowly ears back hair bristling and teeth in evidence
  ponto
 germaines cry was positively totalitarian but the dog lunged at me and i barely had time to close the door in its face
  a few minutes later germaine emerged looking bewildered
 ive never known him to behave like this she said
 i dont like it
 its always been you he was so fond of and he barely tolerated me
 now he seems all mixedup
 after you left he calmed right down and came back and licked my face all over again
 what do you suppose is wrong with him
 can it be fits
  i shook my head
 he doesnt act like fits i said
 hes had a bad go of distemper and is probably suffering from shock
 dogs do get shock you know
 i remember in psychology at harvard they told us about a very intelligent st
 bernard dog which was shocked into complete hysteria by the supernatural
 that is they pulled a lamb chop across the floor by a thread concealed in a crack between the boards
 the dog nearly had heart failure when he saw a chop moving by itself
  but what can we do
 she asked
 lets send him back to the kennels until hes cured
  nope
 from what dr
 whatsisname  dalrymple
  from what dalrymple said hed started acting up at the kennels and hethe vet that isthought ponto would be better off at home
  but we cant have him going for you every time you use your room
  then i wont use it
 ill sleep in the guestroom i added swiftly lest she leap to feminine conclusions
 you might take him another bowl of waterhes all right with youand spread the new york times on the floorand a damned good use for itand bring out my clothes and things
 he seems to have quite a leech for you and well just leave him there to think things over by himself
  how about his food
 she asked
 shouldnt he have a special diet
  no
 ill let him go hungry for a day or so
 so long as he has plenty of water it wont hurt him
 then when hes weak enough so as not to be dangerous ill bring him some nice dogbiscuits and warm milk and hell learn to love me the best way by the alimentary canal
  she looked at me closely you do look rocky she said
 youve had a shock too
 hadnt i better call the doctor
  i shook my head
 no more doctors please
 im out of condition i guess and all this dodging great danes is hard on the nerves
 ill go down and mix myself a brandyandsoda
 you might join me when youve moved my things upstairs
 weve got to talk over a lot of things
  when i finally managed to settle down in my den with a stiff drink i felt besieged bewildered and backed up against the wall
 there could be no reasonable doubt about itthe dog knew
 ponto knew that i was an interloper that the real winnie tompkins no longer existed that a stranger was masquerading in his body and clothes
 the uncanny instinct of a dog had led him to the truth when even winnies wife had been deceived
  this was a new twist in the maze
 i couldnt imagine the master of the ratrace watching with scientific detachment to see whether frank jacklin would make it or would be disqualified in the first round
 of one thing i was certain unless i could establish some kind of personal understanding with ponto suspicion would gather around me
 for the moment germaine did not doubt that i was her husband my conduct had puzzled her but she had lived with winnie so long that it was probable that she no longer specifically noticed him
 virginia rutherford would be more dangerousshe was a woman scorned and she had been tricked out of an intrigue
 she had every motive for digging out or even for inventing the truth but i had given myself a good excuse to keep her at arms length
 she couldnt force her way into my clubs
 i would tell my office staff to keep her away from me and she couldnt be so illbred as to thrust herself into my home
 if i could appease ponto and avoid virginia i had a fair chance of getting away with it
  beg pardon sir
 it was myrtle
  yes mary
  mrs
 rutherford is back sir
 she wants to see you
  tell her i am not at home i replied in a clear carrying tone
 and that i never will be at home to her
  oh yes you will
 it was the redhead
 she was wearing a long mink coat and carrying a short automatic pistol
 like it or not winnie we are going to have a talknow
 she turned to the startled maid
 and dont you try phoning the police myrtle she added or the first thing you will hear is this pistol going pop at mr
 winfred tompkins of new york city and bedford hills
  thats all right mary i added
 dont call the police
 tell mrs
 tompkins that im busy
 mrs
 rutherford and i wish to have a conversation
