 as the door to the room slammed convulsively behind myrtle mrs
 rutherford relaxed laid the automatic on the sofa between us and flung back her mink coat
 she was an appetizing little number if you like em redhaired welldeveloped and mad through and through
  instinctively i started to reach for the gun but was checked by her laugh
  take it by all means she said
 its not loaded
 i only needed it for the maid
 tell me winnie have you got her on your string too
 the maid made or undone as they used to say
  virginia i said firmly i told you earlier this morning that we were through
 theres nothing more to be said about it
 its finished done kaput
 alls well that ends
  she laughed again and looked at me closely
 in spite of myself i began pulling nervously at the lobe of my left ear a habit of mine when confused which has always irritated my dorothy
  there
 virginia said finally thats it
  her voice had a note of finality with a touch of total triumph that i found disturbing
  well have you anything to say
 i asked
  have you anything to say
  ive already said it virginia
 nice as you are and beautiful as you are were washed up
 it wont work and we both know it
 so why not shake hands and quit friends
  she took my proffered hand in hers but instead of shaking it examined it carefully
  very clever she murmured
 youve even got that little mole at the base of your thumb
  of course i have
 its been there since birth
  very very clever winnie she continued but it wont do my winnie because you see you arent my winnie at all
 youre a total stranger
  ive changed i admitted
 im trying to be halfway decent
  whoever wanted winnie to be halfway decent
 she mused
 nobody
 he was much pleasanter as he wasa rich friendly boob
 as for you whoever you are im on to your game
 you arent winfred tompkins and you know it
  i put some heavy sarcasm into my reply
 how did you ever guess mrs
 rutherford
  she laughed airily helped herself to a cigarette and leaned forward while i lighted it so that i could not help seeing deep into the straining v of her blouse
  lots of things
 in the first place you call me virginia when were alone instead of bozo as you always used to do
  i stopped calling you bozo when i made up my mind i began
  nuts to you buddy she rejoined
 then you kept pulling at your ear as though you were milking a cow while i was needling you
 winnie never did that
 when he was in a spot he always reached in his pocket and jingled his change or as a desperate measure twiddled his keys
  dont judge my habits by my hangovers i insisted
 im not feeling well and ive had a sort of psychic shock
  winnie never said psychic in his life poor lamb she observed
 he didnt know what it meant
 no i dont know what your game is but im on to you and were going to be real buddies from now on or  or what
  the police she observed quietly take a dim view of murder in this state
 now im willing to be broadminded
 winnie was a louse who had it coming to him i guess
 i was playing him for a quick divorce and marriage
 three million dollars is a lot of money even in these days and it would have been nice to have been married to it
 but its even nicer this way i guess
  the decanter was within reach
 i poured myself another drink
 have some
 i asked
  and why not
 whats yours is mine and we both need it
  why did you say it was nicer this way mrs
 rutherford
 i inquired
  virginia to you winnie
 its because now i dont have to marry you and i still have a pipeline to the tompkins millions
  so you are going in for blackmail i observed
 suppose i threatened to divorce jimmie and marry you
 after all i still could
  a girl has her pride she murmured
 not that id mind having fun with you winnieas i think id better call you
 but a wife cant give testimony against her husband and i think id rather like to be able to give testimony if needed
 besides a husband has too many opportunities to help the undertaker
 there are accidents in bathtubs and garages medicines get mixed up in the bathroom cabinet and there is always the oldfashioned hatchet
 no since youve managed to get rid of the other winnie somehow i think ill keep a safe distance and my silence as long as you make it worth my while
  suppose i wont play
 i suggested
  then ill go to the police or the f
b
i
theyre supposed to catch kidnappers arent they
and tell them what i know
  i stood up
 this would be easier than i had expected
  okay virginia i said go right ahead
 theres the telephone
 you can use it to call the secret service for all i care
 see what luck you have with your story when my wife is here to testify that im winnie tompkins
  her face paled and her eyes narrowed angrily
 jimmie too
 she asked
 then youre both in it
  were both in what
  the door opened and germaine tompkins stood in the entrance
  virginia rutherford looked trapped and she instinctively pulled her mink back over her shoulders
  nothing jimmie she said at last
 i was foolish enough to hope that if i came back and had a talk alone with winnie we could pick up where we left off
 hes been acting so strangely that he doesnt seem like himself at all
 and so are you
 thats what i meant by saying that you were both in it
  virginia my wife said firmly my husband told you to stay out of this houseand its my home tooand now i find you here
 please go or ill call the police
  the two women exchanged appraising glances which suggested that they were both thoroughly enjoying the touch of melodrama that had come into their wellfed lives
  no its my fault for letting her in i said
 she sent in word by mary  you mean myrtle
  that she would like to see me
 i agreed to do so so you cant blame her
 we talked things over and decided that its all offa few moments of madness but thats all and not worth wrecking two marriages for
 isnt that so mrs
 rutherford
  virginia shook her head
 no winnie it is not so
 jimmie i came here with that gun
 it wasnt loaded but the next time it will be
 i made myrtle or whatever her name is show me in and i told her i would shoot winnie if she gave the alarm
 then i told him what i know about him
  and what is that
 my wife asked
  that he is not winnie at all virginia declared
 that he is an imposter that he and perhaps you had done away with poor old winnie
 i told him that i wouldnt tell his secret if he paid me to keep silent
 and he told me to call the police
  my wife went over to her and took her hand
 poor darling virginia she murmured why dont you go away and have a good rest
 youve got yourself all worked up for a nervous breakdown
 of course its winnie
 im married to him and i ought to know my own husband shouldnt i
 youve simply got run down and all with rationing and warwork
 why dont you let jerry send you for a few weeks to the hartford sanctuary for psychoanalysis and a good rest
  virginia dashed my wifes hand away
 in other words you think im crazy
 she snapped
  no but i do think youre hysterical
 this is winnie im jimmie and youre virginia rutherford
 weve all been letting ourselves get overemotional and this war is a strain on everybody
 dont worry
 jerry can fix it for you quite easily and iwe both will be glad to help pay for it if youre worried about the money
 after all germaine added wryly the whole thing is pretty much of a family affair isnt it
 lets keep it that way
  mrs
 rutherford reached over and grabbed the gun from the sofa
  all right germaine tompkins murderess she grated
 if thats the way youre going to play it ill play too
 dont worry about my mind
 start thinking about the electric chair
 remember in this state they execute women who kill their husbands
  jimmie waited until the door closed behind the doctors wife
 then she turned to me with a curious expression of weariness
  poor man
 she remarked
 you have got yourself into a bad mess havent you
  i nodded
  it didnt seem like one while i was getting into it i said
 its only now when im trying to get things straightened out that it seems so awful
  lets see she continued
 how many women is it youve been trying to keep away from each other
 theres myself of course but wives dont count any more do they
 and theres virginia rutherford and myrtle and there was that blonde actress we met at marthas vineyard last summer and is it one or two girls at the office
  here was where i could object with complete sincerity
 i swear that ive not been fooling with any of the office girls i said
  i know jimmie agreed wisely
 you always used to tell me that it was considered bad for business to play with the help but after i saw the way you went for myrtle i decided that there were exceptions to every rule
  nobody in the office i repeated
 i swear it
  then perhaps it was the office next door
 maybe you brokers have an exchange system for taking on each others stenographerscharge it to business expenses for getting information about each others dealingsbut i know ive heard the name briggs mentioned somehow in your connection
  the name means absolutely nothing to me i insisted
 if it will make you any happier ill admit to a hundred women but im through with all that sexstuff
 from now on im going to be a onewoman man
  germaine faced me with an air of resolution
 would you mind giving me a drink of brandy
 she asked
 ive something to say to you and im afraid you wont like it
  i went to the portable bar and poured her a pony of courvoisier
  here you are
 down the hatch
 and now what is it you want to tell me
  believe me winnie she said its not easy for me
 but id better say it anyhow
 i cant keep on suppressing it
 who are you
  whats that
  who are you
 she repeated
 you look like my husband but you dont talk like him
 his clothes fit you but virginia rutherford is quite rightyou arent winnie tompkins
  how did you guess
  dont think ill give you away she continued
 i wont because you must have had a terribly important reason for doing whatever you have done
 you seem to be in deep trouble of some kind
 iid like to help you if i can
 dont think im hard on my husband
 its been years since weoh you know
 i married him for his money and i still dont know why he married me
 yes i do but ive never liked to admit it
 hed made a lot of money in the market and had built this house
 he needed a wife the way he needed an automobile a portable bar a capehart a thoroughbred great dane and a membership in the pond club
 i was available at a price which he metbut thats all there is to our story
  poor jimmie
 i sympathized
 were both lost i guess
 no im not winnie but i dont know who else i could possibly be
 you see less than twentyfour hours ago i was a lieutenantcommander on a light carrier in the north pacific and  germaine slowly withdrew her hand from mine
  oh
 she exclaimed softly
 oh winnie
 poor old idiot
 ill take care of you and see that you get over this
 wait ill call the doctor right away
 the hartford sanctuarys a very nice place and i can come over every week to  i shook my head
 youll do nothing of the kind my dear i ordered
 no doctor can help me on this one
 besides i added how do you know that i wasnt batty before and have just come to my senses
  her eyes were frightened
 all right dear she agreed
 i like you better this way anyhow
