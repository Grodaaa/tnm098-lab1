 say old man what happened to your hand
 graham wasson plump dark and fortyish but very cleancut and with a dewey dab on his upper lip was my questioner
 he sat across the glasstopped desk in my wall street office while arthurjean briggs typed demurely in the adjoining office
  changing razorblades i confessed
 the damn thing slipped and before i knew it i made a grab for it
 lucky it didnt go deep
 hence the surgical gauze and the lousy signature
 do you think you can get my check cleared through the bank or should i write winnie x tompkins his mark
  wasson chuckled like a wellfed broker
 well get enough witnesses to your john hancock to make it legal he promised
 now what youve got to do is to ease old lady fynch into the trustees delight and take a gander at her former investments
 ive brought the list with me
 as you know she insisted that you okay the deal
  i glanced at the typed list
 this stuff looks pretty good to me graham i said
 detroit edisons safe as the washington monument a
t
t
 is solid and g
e
 ought to do all right with this new electronic stuff
  dr
 rutherford was pacing with surgical precision up and down my den
 he looked slightly more selfpossessed than the day before and seemed to be in excellent physical condition
 i guessed at the contour beneath my wadded black silk dressing gown and reconsidered my original plan to throw him bodily out of the house for having come without my invitation
  and how
 my partner agreed
 boy
 what a windfall
 stuff like that is scarcer than hens teeth on the open market
 with close to a million bucks to turn over we ought to do pretty well on this
 heres what were buying for her
  wasson passed me a slip of paper
 the trustees delight he said
 gbonds
 you buy em we should worry
 no money back for ten years
 morgenthaus dreamchild
  the slip was attached to a printed treasury form
 see here i pointed out
 these damn bonds depreciate 2
2 a year for the first five years and then start climbing up the ladder again and theyre nontransferable
  thats it winnie
 the trustees delight wasson agreed
 they pay 212 a year if you hold them but if you try to sell them within five years the discount means you only get about 
03 on your money
 once a trustee has put you aboard this rollercoaster he cant conscientiously advise you to get out
  who dreamed up that swindle
  oh a couple of dollarayear bankers we sent down to help the treasury win the war
 its a natural
 its patriotic to invest in warbonds
 the yields conservative as hell and you get it all back if you wait long enough
  but what if the old girl dies within the next five years
 wont the estate be liquidated
 how will the heirs feel when they have to take a loss of 60000
  thats their worry winnie wasson pointed out
 all we have to do is sign the papers and la fynch gets about 25000 a year for the rest of her life
  instead of the 40000 a year shes getting out of her present investments now
  sure winnie
 were not in business for our health
 industrials are risky and miss fynch is awful set on beating hitler
 we take over her present portfolio and take our chances on the market
 if values shift were in a position to unloadbut fast
 she isnt
 she only gets to town twice a year once between bar harbor and long island and then next time from palm beach to long island
 come on winnie stick your fist on these papers and ill handle the transfers
  i shook my head
 id like to think this over i said
 if i was an old woman and expected only five or ten more years of life id be hanged if id tie myself down to these financial mustardplasters
 it sounds okay to be patriotic but i think id stick to the greater risks and higher yields and get a run for my money
 tell you what graham you phone and tell her id like to have a talk with her before she makes up her mind
  wasson shoved back his chair and faced me bristling
 ill be damned if i will
 this is a natural and handled right is worth 100000 to the firm
 you talked her into it and now if youre getting cold feet you can talk her out of it
 all i know is that youve gone nuts
  we arent so hard up that we have to swindle old ladies
  swindle my eye
 whats wrong about 25000 a year guaranteed by your uncle sam
  less income tax i reminded him
  oh surethat  well its about 15000 a year less than shes getting now
 if she sold out and invested in an annuity she could get about 70000 a year taxfree
 no i dont want to rush her into this
  then youve forgotten how we made our pile in the first place my partner growled
 phil cone and i will have to talk this over
 this is a fine time to go soft on us
  i grinned at him
 go on talk it over
 if you want out youre welcome
 id rather like you to stick around as im on to something really big and i dont want the street to say we fleeced our clients
  i resent that winnie wasson snapped
  what else would you call it
 reinvesting
  listen he exploded
 you built up this business
 you invented the methods
 im damned if i let you call me a swindler for following your lead
 and he stormed out slamming the door
 a moment later he stuck his head in again
 forget it winnie
 if youre working on a big operation count me in
  i studied the list of the fynch investments again and the more i saw it the more i wondered how anybody but a fool would fall for the proposition of putting money in the government bonds for ten years when you could clean up outside government
  there was a tap on the edge of my desk
 i looked up to see arthurjean
 mr
 harcourt is back to see you she said
 ill get set with the stenotype
 and dont worry about that fynch dame
 ill give you a fillin later
 she knows what shes doing
  fine
 i told her
 now you show mr
 harcourt in and make with the stenotype
 did you finish copying what we said yesterday
  her mouth dropped open and her sweater quivered eloquently
 omigawd
 baby
 i clean forgot
  mr
 harcourt seemed much more vital and selfpossessed than on the previous afternoonperhaps because he had obviously had a sleep a shower and a hearty breakfast presumably prefaced by ten minutes of vigorous pushups and toetouching in bathroom calisthenics
 at any rate he looked fit
  morning harcourt i said casually
 sorry to tell you that miss briggs was home with a bad headache last night and wasnt able to make that copy of our talk yesterday
  gmen on duty are not supposed to smile without written permission from their immediate superior but harcourt must have had an extra helping of wheaties for breakfast
 call yourself a headache mr
 tompkins
 he asked
 thats who our man reported miss briggs had last night at 157 east 51st street third floor front
 can i get her some aspirin
  there are no secrets from the gestapo i observed and i have no comment to offer except to say next time come on up and have a drink with us instead of doing the gman in a cold and drafty doorway across the street
  the special agent gave an entirely unofficial wink at arthurjean
 oh hell he remarked
 whats the use of all this coy stuff
 the bureau isnt interested in your private life
 what i wanted to say mr
 tompkins is that i reported our talk to my chief and he teletyped my report down to washington
 were not going to fool around with church street on this one
 the directors going to take it up direct with admiral ballister at the navy department
 for my part i told him i thought it was all a pipedream but like i said the f
b
i
 doesnt believe in dreams that come true
  arthurjean crossed the room and stood behind him pressing a little unregenerately against the back of his chair until harcourt remarked conversationally to u
 s
 grant in the engraving im a married man baby with a wife and kids in brooklyn
  my secretary smiled and gave him a smart tap on the top of his head
 youre a good boy junior she told him and im all for you
 but dont you go making trouble for this dumb boss of mine or ill call on your wife personal and tell all
  harcourt murmured to the engraving that unconditional surrender was his name too but that tompkins was making so much trouble for himself that he was damned if he could see how the f
b
i
 could make it any worse
 in any case he added more directly he would keep in touch with me and let me know whether i was wanted up at the federal court house
  see here harcourt i replied
 one good turn doesnt make a spring
 this is the screwiest case youve ever been on
 if you can drop in and visit miss briggs and myself on saturday after lunch at our place ill give you a fillin that will rock the f
b
i
 from its gats to its toupees
  thats mighty white of youand miss briggs the special agent allowed
 if the chief lets me ill meet you up there say about 230
  swell
 i said
 and which do you preferscotch or rye
  i dont drink on duty he told me but i find bourbon helps fight off colds this early spring weather
  after his departure i locked myself in the office and with arthurjeans help brought myself up to date on winnies business operations
 tompkins wasson  cone were not as i had believed a hightoned bucketshop
 the proposed fynch swindle was only the result of a dopey old maid who practically insisted on helping beat the axis by turning her money into government bonds
 there was plenty of honest graft and many a solid perquisite in straight commission work and supervision of estates
 the firm was not of course very scrupulous but it always gave value for its transactions
 it was in fact a pretty slick setup
  there was a buzz on my interoffice telephone and the receptionist announced mr
 axel roscommon to see you mr
 tompkins
  oh ask him to see one of the other partners will you
  i told him that you were too busy but he said he must see you and would wait
  he too
 i asked
 okay
 send him in
 do you know an axel roscommon arthurjean
  uhuh
 she shook her head
 the names sorta familiar
 something in oil before pearl harbor
 i can find out if youll wait a bit
  never mind i told her
 ill see him
 you stay in the next room and keep the door ajar so you can take a record
  she laughed
 i can do better than that boss
 ill switch down the interoffice phones and keep the door shut
 that way
 ill hear every word you say
 its like a dictaphone
  mr
 roscommon was an extremely well set up man in the middle fifties about sixfeet two lean with iron grey hair a grey moustache steelblue eyes and a beartrap grip
 he looked prosperous but not worried by it
 he spoke with a faint irish lilt in his voice but his manner was most direct and unhibernian
  mr
 tompkins he remarked
 you must excuse the lack of formality but you will understand when i tell you that i am chief of the german intelligence organization in the united states
 now dont think im crazy or indiscreet
 the only reason i have come to you is because my agents in the f
b
i
 tell me that you are involved in the sinking of u
s
s
 alaska off the aleutians
 thorium bombs wasnt it
 chalmis was a pretty smart chap and i warned our people that he was getting hot
 now i dont ask you why in wotans name the fuehrer thinks it makes sense to have two intelligence services in this country
 probably berlin didnt like my last reports
 no dont get excited
 ive engaged in no subversive activities im an irish free state citizen and if you go to washington youll find that they know all about me
 hitler may want the old goetterdaemmerung spirit in our outfit but i cant see the point of too much zeal
  i offered him a cigarette
 what do you want to see me about mr
 roscommon
 i asked
 for all you know there may be dictaphones planted all over the place
 my last visitor today was actually a special agent of the f
b
i
  roscommon lighted his cigarette with a flick of a gold dunhill lighter
 that would be harcourta
 j
 harcourtwouldnt it
 a fine chap and a conscientious agent
 id heard hed been assigned to your case
 youll find him completely reliable
 as you know in time of war there has to be some practical way of maintaining direct confidential communication between the enemies
 switzerland
 bah
 all milk chocolate profiteering and eyewash
 i wouldnt trust a swiss as far as i could throw the subtreasury building
 im acting here for berlin and you have at least three men in berlin to keep in touch with the german government over there
 thats the only practical way modern wars can be fought eh
 as edith cavell said last time patriotism is not enough
 the fact is that even in war two great countries like germany and america must and do maintain direct contact
  i pushed the button for arthurjean
 miss briggs i asked have we any brandy in the office
  deadpan and nonchalant she crossed the room to a small safe disguised as a victorian lowboy twiddled the dials and revealed a neat little frigidaire
 she prepared two brandies and soda handed them to us and returned to her office
  prosit
 said i
  heil roosevelt
 roscommon answered
  but what did you want to see me about
 i inquired
 you may be all right but im already under investigation by the f
b
i
  nonsense old boy nonsense he reassured me
 if they get troublesome let me knowim in the phone book and my girl will always know where to reach me day or nightand ill tell washington to stop proceedings
 no tompkins what i wanted to tell you was thatwhen you report back to your superior and ill lay tentoone hes that ass ribbentropjust tell him that the wars lost
 our game now is to salvage resources for the next war which will be against russia unless i miss my guess
 weve got to use these last few weeks and days to rush funds patents papers brains and organization out of the reich
 send them to sweden to switzerland to italy
 fly them to spain slip them in uboats to buenos aires or dublin
 tell ribbentrop that new york understands our problem and will play the game right across the board but there must be no shillyshallying no nonsense about last stands
 if hitler wants a siegfried finish let him have it but from now on our job is to save germany as an asset for her western allies and as a people whom the world will need to fight the soviets
 tell him that will you old man
 thanks most awfully
  roscommon finished his drink with an expert swirl of the glass smiled shook hands and left the room as abruptly as he had arrived in it
 i picked up the outside phone
  get me f
b
i
 headquarters i said
 i wish to speak to mr
 a
 j
 harcourt
 thanks ill wait
