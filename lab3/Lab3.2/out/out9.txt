   and so  arthurjean   i concluded   my guess is that for some crazy reason its up to me to take up where winnie left off and try to do a good job with the hand hes dealt himself
   she remained silent  hunched on the floor beside me  with her maroon pyjamas straining visibly and a pile of cigarette butts in the ash tray at her side
   give me a break   i pleaded
  when i tried to tell my wife  winnies wife  mrs
 tompkins  that is  all she could think of was to send me off to a plush lined booby hatch until i was sane again
 the others  at least virginia rutherford  are beginning to suspect that something is wrong and that damned dog knows it
 so be original and pretend that i might be telling the truth
   she didnt answer
 instead  she stood up  stretched  strolled over to the kitchenette and mixed us both two good stiff drinks
   mud in your eye
  she said
   glad to see you on board
    i dont see why not   she observed conversationally
  i dont pretend to be smart and i know that the other girls in the office think im nothing but a tramp because i dont pretend i dont like men  but im damned if i think that winnie  who is one of gods sweetest dumb bells  could have dreamed up anything as screwy as this
    as i remember him  he wasnt any too bright   i said
   skip it
 he wasnt dumb in business
 he picked up a couple of million bucks and gave them a good home in his safe deposit box
 he wasnt so hot on music and books and art  except for his damned ducks  but he was a lot of fun
 he liked a good time and he liked a girl to have a good time
 he should have been born in one of those latin countries where the women do all the work and the men play guitars  drink and make love
   i drew a deep breath
 i had won my first convert
 i knew what paul of tarsus felt when he met up with timothy
 i thought of mahomet and fatima  karl marx and bakunin  hitler and hess
 crazy though the whole world would consider me  here was one human being who could listen to my story without phoning for an ambulance
   tell me about this frank jacklin   arthurjean remarked
  i dont get all the angles about him and this dorothy
 seems to me you  winnie  that is  told me he was the guy shed had a sort of crush on at school
 winnie was still sort of sore about it twenty years later
    its hard for me to be fair   i admitted
  jacklin was a big shot at school and may have had a swelled head
 winnie wasnt so hot then  nice but with too much money
 jacklins people were poor  by comparison that is
 he got through yale  slid out into the newspaper game  held his job  married a girl  had a bust up with his wife and joined the navy as a reserve officer after she walked out on him
 the navy assigned him to p
r
o
 work and sent him to the pacific
    he sounds like a heel   she observed   leaving his wife like that
 tell me more about her
 is she pretty
   i thought a long time
  i dont quite know   i said finally
  i never knew
 she was necessary to me  long after i was necessary to her
 she had a mole on her left hip and a gruff way of talking when she was really fond of me
 i guess she got tired of living in hartford and took it out on me
    any kids
   i shook my head vigorously
  cost too much on a newspaper salary
 she said she didnt want any until we could afford them
 i was fool enough to believe her
 then when we could afford them she didnt want them
 cant say i blame her
    did she make you happy
    of course not
 who wants to be happy
 she made me miserable  but it was exciting to be around her
 i never knew what id find when i got home  a knockdown drag out fight over nothing at all or hearts and flowers equally over nothing
   arthurjean yawned
  that parts convincing   she agreed
  ill play this one straight
 youre frank jacklin  and  winnie tompkins rolled into one
 the point is  where do we go from here
 lets see you sign jacklins name
   i pulled out winnies gold  life time fountain pen and wrote  frank e
 jacklin  over and over again on the back of an envelope
 she studied it carefully
   thats no phony   she agreed   and its nothing like winnies handwriting
 think i could get a check cashed on it
    lets try   i suggested
  tomorrow when i get to the office ill pre date a check on the riggs bank at washington
 you mail it in for collection and well see if it clears
   she shook her head
  no dice
 if i tried that  first thing we know wed have the a
b
a
 dicks after you for forgery
 can you think of anything else
    not unless you go to washington and see dorothy in o
s
s
 and ask her to verify my handwriting
 or  wait
 you can go and talk to her and notice whether she wriggles her nose to keep her spectacles up
 you can find out whether shes still nuts about prokofiev
 you can ask if she still thinks that ernest hemingway is a worse writer than charles dickens  and whether she still uses chanels gardenia perfume
    thats enough   she interrupted
  but howm i going to get to washington and do all these things
    next week   i said   you and i can fly down on a business trip  war contracts  cut backs  something official  and while im being whip sawed by the desk heroes you can check on dorothy
 see if im not right
   she nodded
  thats one way
 what can we cook up
 the office is tied up in estate work and that leaves no chance for uncle sam
 you get what he leaves the heirs and they tell me that the inheritance tax is here to stay
   i considered the problem
  tell you what  arthurjean   i replied
  ive been thinking this over
 the wars going to end this summer
 what i saw on the alaska means that nobody can hold out against us
 the germans are on their last legs  but most of the wise guys are saying that it will take from eighteen months to two years to clean up japan  a million casualties  billions of dollars
 this thorium bomb will do the trick and the war will be over by labor day
 theres a chance for winnie tompkins to make another two or three millions
   she laughed sardonically
  how
    theres uranium stocks   i suggested
   all sewed up by the insiders
 last year you  or winnie  got a query on uranium and found that there wasnt any to be had
    theres wheat and sugar   i argued
  the worlds going to be hungry
 theres a famine coming sure as hell
 buy futures and well be set
    sure   she agreed   if you want to buy black and can get funds into cuba or the argentine
 but there are inter allied pools operating in sugar and wheat and you cant break into the game without connections at washington
    how about peace babies
  i demanded
  we can sell our war bonds and invest in something solid for post war reconstruction
 say general motors or u
s
 steel
   arthurjean crossed the room and rumpled my head affectionately
  baby   she observed   its damn lucky for you and winnies dough i know my way around the street
 lay off heavy industrials until the labor business gets straightened out
 its all set for a big strike wave when the shooting stops and a lot of investors are going to be burned
 you can sell short of course but youll have to wait for that
 if you must go in for gambling  try the race track or the slot machines
 uncle sam has it fixed so that the only way you can make money out of the peace is to be a swiss or a swede
    but that doesnt make sense   i objected
  in any place and at any time  advance knowledge on what is going to happen is worth a fortune
 how about selling some of the war industries short
   she shook her head
  you wait till youve been to washington
 some of the smart guys down there may know the answers
 perhaps it will be real estate  if they can only get rid of rent control
 probably it will be surplus war stocks but thats going to be a political racket
 anyhow the tax collector will be waiting for you  so why worry
    speaking of cashing checks   i reminded her   how in hell am i going to get some dough
 how does winnie sign himself at the city farmers anyhow
   she laughed
  he has three or four separate accounts
 the one he uses for purely personal hell raising is just signed w
 s
 tompkins
 lets see you try to write that
 remember he loops all his letters and draws a little circle instead of a dot over the i
   i tried that a few times until she shook her head
   there isnt a bank clerk in new york who wouldnt stop a check with that on it
 lets see  he signed his name to something around here
 see if you cant copy it
   she fumbled under a pile of magazines and finally came up with a copy of  the story of philosophy  by will durant
   winnie thought this would be good for me   she explained
  here it is  for miss arthurjean briggs  with the compliments of w
 s
 tompkins
 he was like that  sort of formal  it gave him a kick
 he bought that for me second hand after wed been drinking atlantic city dry at an investment bankers convention
 try it
   i tried the signature again but the effort was even worse than my free hand efforts
 this time it looked like what it was  a clumsy forgery
   hell   i exclaimed   ive simply got to do better than that
 how about my tracing it
    youd be surprised   she told me   how easy it is to spot a signature thats been traced
 its something about the flow of the ink and the angle of the pen
 no two signatures are exactly alike and thats why a tracing gives itself away
 they got machines which spot it
    well  howm i going to get some dough
  i demanded
  i cant draw on jacklins washington account  and the chances are there isnt much there anyhow
 and if i try to draw on tompkins account ill find myself in the hoosegow
   she got up and mixed us another pair of drinks
  i got it   she announced
  it wont be too nice for you but its better than starving
    you mean youll lend me some
    hell  baby  i got no money  twenty five or thirty in the account and a few hundreds in war bonds
 no  this is better
 just hold out your hand and shut your eyes
   it sounded like jewels
 i leaned back in the chair  closed my eyes and extended my right hand in front of me  palm upward
 i heard her pad into the bathroom
 when she came back  her voice sounded strained as she whispered   this is it  baby
 keep those eyes shut
   there was a smooth  tingling sensation across the tips of my fingers  then my right hand was suddenly warm and wet
 i opened my eyes to see arthurjean holding a stained safety razor blade in her hand and staring at me  white faced  as the blood trickled from my finger tips
   winnie    she faltered  and slumped down in the divan
  i hastily grabbed the handkerchief from my breast pocket and wrapped it around my throbbing fingers
   ouch
 damn you
  i exclaimed
   im sorry  baby   she whispered
  i didnt want to hurt you
 it seemed the only way      you damned fool   i almost shouted at her
  do you realize you flopped with that blade in your hand and might have cut an artery
    no  did i
  she scrambled up hastily and looked around
  gee  i feel lousy
 does it hurt much
    not yet
 whats the big idea
    now you sound like winnie   she replied
  he never got ideas easy
 listen  you big slob  if youve cut your fingers you got to have a bandage and if you got a bandage on your right hand  your signatures going to be screwy
 all you need do is fumble it and i or one of the girls will witness it and the bank will clear it and youll get the dough
   i thought that one over
  youve got something in your head besides those big blue eyes   i admitted
  now if you only have some iodine and bandages well see if i can stave off lock jaw
   she giggled
  lock jaws the last thing  youll  get   she said
  there ought to be something in the medicine cabinet
 gee   she added
  i suppose ill have to get you undressed and dress you in the morning just like a baby
 aint that something
    how about some food
  i demanded
  you said something about a steak back at the office and all youve given me is scotch and razor blades
 you get on with your cooking and let me try to fix my hand
   i went into the bathroom  located some mercurochrome and a box of band aids
 once the flow of blood had slacked  i managed to incapacitate myself sufficiently for the purpose of forging winnie tompkins signature
   say  winnie
  arthurjean suddenly appeared at the bathroom door  with an aroma of steak behind her
  ive just figured out something
 if you arent winnie but a ringer from the aleutians  its not decent for you to see me in my pyjamas
 were strangers
    oh  keep em on till after dinner   i said
  i wont stand on ceremony
 im hungry
   she laughed
  you sure can make like winnie   she admired
  jesus  the steaks burning
